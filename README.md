# N328 Final Project Documentation

<p>
	For this assignment I went back to my political science roots and decided to search for a dataset involving the vote in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. I found a dataset on Kaggle.com that included detailed data points of voter turnout categorized by each individual state. This data included the number of voters that turned out for the election by state, the number of eligible voters, number of registered voters, and the total percentage of voter turnout among registered voters. Since the 2020 Presidential Election was one of the closest and contentious elections in recent American history, I chose to focus my data visualization on the percent of eligible voters that turned out in 10 of the most vital battleground states: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, as well as the entirety of the United States’ voter turnout percentage for comparison.

	In order to demonstrate and compare the percentage of eligible voters per state that voted I had to think of a way to best compare amounts in a data visualization. I eventually settled on making the percent of turnout a size value channel in a column chart with the y-axis measuring the percent numerically and lined up each state alphabetically along the x-axis. The y-axis scale uses ticks of 10 percent starting from zero percent and extends to just over 80 percent since the maximum percent value is 79. The cap on the height of the y-axis at 80 percent allows for a closer look at the columns to better observe the variation between states. Height is an effective mark able to show quantitative values, such as percentage of a whole, and allows for quick visual comparison between the states’ turnout percentage. Taller column equates to larger percent turnout.  Since this project requires an interactive component to this visualization, my first idea was to have one large pie chart and implement an ability to change which state percent the pie chart illustrated. This is my first time working with html, JavaScript, and d3 so I found this idea novel but very difficult to create. I settled on the column chart because it can show the comparison of percentage by height, and I could add some interactive nature to each of the state’s columns individually. I was able to add to the d3 code a process that would change the color channel of the state’s column the user’s mouse was hovering over to either red or blue, which represents which party the battleground state voted for, and once the mouse left the column would return to its neutral grey color in which it started. I chose to add the states on the x-axis alphabetically due to the attribute’s simple categorical nature.

The main purpose of illustrating a derivable conclusion from battleground state turnout in an election was to see which party the state ended up voting for, and the purpose of adding the height/percentage attribute was to see if there was any observable correlation between turnout and party choice. What I discovered from this visualization was that most of the battleground states had an eligible voter turnout of between 60 to 70 percent, and that three of the states (Florida, Michigan, and Wisconsin) had turnout over 70 percent. This also shows that out of the 10 states only Florida and Ohio voted red for Republican. Both states’ turnout was roughly 70, and higher than the turnout rate of the country. Unfortunately, this visualization demonstrates that there is not an easily observable correlation between turnout percentage and which party the people chose during the 2020 election. It does show that, in comparison to the total turnout percent of the United States, most of the battleground states had similar turnout percentage.
